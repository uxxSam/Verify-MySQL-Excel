# Verify-MySQL-Excel
This is a python template to verify data import to MySQL database from Excel by comparing all the records.
For my internship project, I had to import data from Excel to MySQL and wrote this python tool to help make sure the data is correctly imported to MySQL database.
Although this file is specific to a certain Excel file and its content, it can be easily modified for other ones.
